Last thing I heard before I died
Was 10 frightened doctors talking aside
9 out of 10 doctors argued that I,
Giving my blood loss, will surely die
9 out of 10 friends that gathered around
Cried when they lowered me into the ground
9 out of 10 thought that I was gone
9 out of 10 times, oh, they were wrong

This circle of torture and pain will end
If I will rate you and will recommend
I resurrect and then again
I whisper right into your ear
9 out of 10

A shot to the face, an axe to the neck
A dart to the eye, a stab in the back
Thrown in the ocean, fed to the pigs
Honey, you should know better than this
Fall from the mountain onto the knife
Poisoned with lead then buried alive
Cut into pieces by thousand men
It’s getting better, still 9 out of 10

This circle of torture and pain will end
If I will rate you and will recommend
I resurrect and then again
I whisper right into your ear
9 out of 10

Remember what you said?
You said I’ll soon be dead
You said I had one wish
My only wish - a perfect murder
The powers that you have
But nothing in your head
You said I had one wish
And now I’m practically immortal

The time is going fast
How many years have passed?
You used to beat me then
Until I got it truly perfect
The time is going fast
How many years have passed?
I die and live again
You’ll never get the truly perfect ten

This circle of torture and pain will end
If I will rate you and will recommend
I resurrect and then again
I whisper right into your ear
9 out of 10

I resurrect and then again
I whisper right into your ear
9 out of 10
