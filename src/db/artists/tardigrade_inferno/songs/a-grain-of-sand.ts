This night is long and dark, like the one before
I spend them both with eyes open, lying on the floor
A man - a being of water, but after crying dry
My head is like an hourglass with desert sand inside

Careful and quiet, a loving hand
Is placing beside you a grain of sand
Your happiest dream is for you to dwell
Goodnight, sweetheart. Sleep well.

It's just a twist of fate, it's not for me to choose
And now I'm on the edge and sand may be of use
It's not about me, I hope you'll understand
Your head is full of water, my hand is full of sand

Careful and quiet, a loving hand
Is placing beside you a grain of sand
Your happiest dream is for you to dwell
Goodnight, sweetheart. Sleep well.

Baby, baby, don’t you cry
Sand is falling from the sky
You need just a single grain
And the sky will pour down rain

Single grain and pain will end
I’m on my knees, I’m bleeding sand
I’ll close the door, I’ll kill the light
I’ll be your sandman for the night

Careful and quiet, a loving hand
Is placing beside you a grain of sand
Your happiest dream is for you to dwell
