I’m here for the tribute
From farmers all around
I’m here to collect the pigs
For royal hunting ground
And hunger is upon you
You’re eating your own kids!
But there is no excuse for you -
I need my bloody pigs!

You’re eating your own cattle
So you don’t starve to death!
Now, do you even realise
You put me under stress?
You’re messing with my planning!
You’re tearing me apart!
But I just might have an idea
For you to play your part!

Where are the pigs now?
What a mix up!
Truly, what a shame!
Breeding, growing,
Where we are going
All pigs are the same!

Lets saw your arms and legs off -
For now they are too long!
And ears are short, I’ll have to stretch.
And cut away your tongue!
And soon it will be over
Just think of this instead:
You will be royal hunting pigs -
At least you will be fed!

Where are the pigs now?
What a mix up!
Truly, what a shame!
Breeding, growing,
Where we are going
All pigs are the same!

You are pigs now!
Alive somehow
Growing day by day
You’ll be going
The next morning
To your final stay

A King wants entertainment!
We’re on the hunting ground!
But there is no guard left alive
And only pigs around
They quickly knock him over!
He’s screaming underneath!
And we must have forgotten to
Remove their bloody teeth!

Where are the pigs now?
What a mix up!
Truly, what a shame!
They keep going!
They keep growing!
All pigs are the same!
