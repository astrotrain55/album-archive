Hello, hello, my darlings
Ain’t that a lovely sight?
Roll up and gather round
We have a show for you
TONIGHT!

To all who in a back rows  -
You want to die of age?
There sure will be a chance, now
Come closer to stage
and DANCE!

There is a cavern where
The King of Maggots lies
A granter of all wishes
A devil in disguise
When tardigrades were fragile
A lonely tardigrade
Came to the King of Maggots
To wish and was betrayed

You want to live forever
No death, no agony
This is beyond my power
Can’t fool the entropy
But I can make you stronger
Impossible to kill
Immune to heat and hunger
A gesture of goodwill

A wicked catch embedded
In this demonic spell
A body dies and after
A soul will go to hell
Immune to all the torment
Immune to hellish flame
They colonized inferno
For them it’s all the same

Hello, hello, my darlings
Ain’t that a lovely sight?
Roll up and gather round
We have a show tonight

To all who in a back rows  -
You want to die of age?
There sure will be a chance, now
Come closer to this stage
and DANCE!

A smell of burning eyelids
And crying from below
The Tardigrade Inferno
Is perfect for the show!
