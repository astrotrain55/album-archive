It’s the arrival of a train
To my forgotten lizard brain
Into the heart, into the vein
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo goes the train!

It’s the arrival of a train
And all your fears, sweat and pain
Are lost like tears in the rain
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo goes the train!

It’s coming
For everything you care about
Hear chugging of the wheels
That’s all your fears coming true!
The train is coming
And everything you love will perish
And the last thing you will hear
Choo! Choo! Choo! Choo!

Await arrival of a train
It will be gone, you will remain
The future truly is insane
Just wait until we make a plane

And you will die under the train
Your blood will flow down the drain
And all your struggles are in vain
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo goes the train!

It’s coming
For everything you care about
Hear chugging of the wheels
That’s all your fears coming true!
The train is coming
And everything you love will perish
And the last thing you will hear
Choo! Choo! Choo! Choo!

The metal train is coming right into the village
The metal train is coming right into my head
And will I find myself running from its image
Or will I ride it to the sunset at the end?

Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo goes the train!

It’s coming
For everything you care about
Hear chugging of the wheels
That’s all your fears coming true!
The train is coming
And everything you love will perish
And the last thing you will hear
Choo! Choo! Choo! Choo!
