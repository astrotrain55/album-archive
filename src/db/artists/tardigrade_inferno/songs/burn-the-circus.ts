Once upon an early autumn
As the rain was pouring down
One of the circus acrobats
Fell for a happy clown
Acrobat came to that clown
Trembling from within
Why I never see you laughing
But I always see you grin

I feel absolutely nothing
Said the happy clown
If you want to see me laughing
Burn the circus down

I remember you were joyful
I remember how you laughed
At the death of the magician
When he sawed himself in half
I hadn't heard your favorite song
You hummed for quite a while
You used to sing, but now you're silent
With your creepy concrete smile

I don’t feel anything
Said the happy clown
If you want to hear me sing, please,
Burn the circus down

I have traveled with this circus
All across the map
Now it pinned my soul in place
Like a mousetrap
One day circus tent caught fire
I've noticed something odd
I've been so absurdly happy
Like I'm fucking ten years old

All my life and my routine
Just a big letdown
Take a can of gasoline
Burn the circus down

Acrobat just turned away
They walked their separate ways
And the happy clown kept on smiling,
Dreaming of the world ablaze
And one day they woke up
In bed side-by-side
Let’s burn down this circus
With all of them inside

So they stayed in the burning circus
Never to be found
What’s the moral of that story,
What’s it all about?
If life fails to amuse you
Do it all yourself
Take the match and light the fuse
And burn your fucking self
