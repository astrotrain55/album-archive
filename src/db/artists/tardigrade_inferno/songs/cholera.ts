Is this help sign big enough?
I’m holding it above my head,
I’m staying just to see
How everything will end
And just to hear your honest laugh

Am I just making an excuse?
A part of me thinks that I am
Another part of me
Is telling you and them:
My body still can be of use

I’ll gladly die in front of you
Just trying to communicate
That Smallpox and Plague will seal our fate
Wait, and Influenza will arrive
Live a Scarlet Fever dream alive

I read the news today, oh boy!
It’s printed all across my face!
Impossible to miss,
And also to erase
I’m barely standing broken toy

I’ll gladly die in front of you
Just trying to communicate
That Smallpox and Plague will seal our fate
Wait, and Influenza will arrive
Live a Scarlet Fever dream alive

A metaphorical disease
It is not perfect, but what is?
I’m staying just to see the end
Cholera is my dearest friend

Is this help sign big enough?
I’ve carved it right into my skin
It is the only thing
That keeps my mind clean
I'm simply looking for some love

I’ll gladly die in front of you
Just trying to communicate
That Smallpox and Plague will seal our fate
Wait, and Influenza will arrive
Live a Scarlet Fever dream alive

I’m staying just to see the end
Cholera is my dearest friend
