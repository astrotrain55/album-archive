You want asylum?
A church asylum?
You want my guidance,
A sanctuary?
This is my guidance -
You keep your silence!
We need reliance
Till the very end!

Spread the word of Lord Almighty
Let the sunshine in your heart
Pray so hard till you no longer
Can tell love and hate apart

I demand silence!
In the asylum!
Leave your defiance
At your quarter
You roughless killer!
You deadly sinner!
I serve you dinner
Bread and water

Spread the word of Lord Almighty
Let the sunshine in your heart
Pray so hard till you no longer
Can tell love and hate apart

IÂ´ve just found out
I know about
Your bodycount
Bloody slaughter
You roughless killer!
You deadly sinner!
So no more dinner,
No more water!

You asked for guidance
You brought here violence
And your defiance
And denial
A resolution -
An execution!
Or absolution
And exile

Spread the word of Lord Almighty
Let the sunshine in your heart
Pray so hard till you no longer
Can tell love and hate apart
