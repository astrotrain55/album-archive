My clockwork is supreme
It is Turing complete
It's better than the flesh
Because the bodies tend to bleed
I'm making a machine
With cog and torsion spring
A human-like construction that can
Talk, and dream, and feel, and think

Everything we know
Leads us to the next
The mind is the contraption
That has grown too complex
If only I could make
A god from the machine
Multiply complexity until
It gains form and will

First, there was the God Almighty
From the God came Soul Eternal
Then the Soul commanded body
Body made the cog

From the cog I'll make a body
With the spring I'll make a mind
When the mind grows almighty
Then I'll make the Clockwork God

I’m spending days and nights on my impossible invention
I left my mind open for divine intervention
While artificial humans will be sure someone’s focus
For me, it’s but a step to my divine magnum opus
The forward march of science gives us all that it can bring
But all that I will need is just a chain, a cog, a spring
And while the copper parts grow exponentially in size
I fear there is one thing that I have yet to realize

First, there was the God Almighty
From the God came Soul Eternal
Then the Soul commanded body
Body made the cog

From the cog I'll make a body
With the spring I'll make a mind
When the mind grows almighty
Then I'll make the Clockwork God

Cos’ everything miraculous
Can be expressed with calculus
Got nothing but my sweat and blood
To reverse engineer the God
But I’ve spent years with no success
There’s no solution, it makes no sense
A blank space sits amidst my scripts
I’ve tried it all, but nothing fits

What if there’s no god almighty?
And there is no soul eternal?
There is brain and there is body
And there is a cog
From the cog I made a body
With the spring I made a mind
Will the mind grow almighty
And become a god?

I need more parts to make a god
Than there are atoms in the world
There is less copper than I need
My perfect vision is incomplete

The revelation came to me
The God is but a fantasy
There is no God, the image's fake
The only God - the one we make

First, there is no god almighty
And there is no soul eternal
There is brain and there is body
And there is a cog

From the cog I made a body
With the spring I made a mind
There is nothing that's almighty
So the mind prays…
To the Clockwork God
