Don’t you cry and don’t you worry
I will put on clown dress
I will sing and tell a story
I will help you with your stress
Have no fear whatsoever
Promise that you will be nice
But I beg you, don’t you ever
Look into my lifeless eyes

I signed up for clown care
Thinking that it’s just a game
But I’ve seen so much despair
That I’ll never be the same
Loss of limbs and brain cancer
Burning, countless degrees
Tell me if there is an answer?
Why they all deserve all this?

Little angel shaved my head
Drew fibrosis on my skin
Hello children, god is dead
Let the clown therapy begin

It can not be nature’s lesson -
Cancer at the age of ten
I will have to put my dress on
I will have to smile again
Little angel hold my lips
As I’m frowning upside-down
You do not deserve all this
Oh, don’t listen to that silly clown

Little angel shaved my head
Drew fibrosis on my skin
Hello children, god is dead
Let the clown therapy begin
