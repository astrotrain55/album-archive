Life is not fair
People everywhere
Are spending years analyzing
A fictional affair
Think of global warming!
Help me spread the warning!
And forget about it
By tomorrow morning

Youâ€™ve got time to spare
Tell me, will you dare
To spend your life as a volunteer
So life could be fair?
And when you were younger
You didn't die of hunger!
Think of all the children starving -
An impressive number!

Tell me now how you sleep
Safe from bombs and falling fires.
Will your world just die when
They pull out tubes and wires?
Your compassion is strong
It just goes and comes along
And the only way to end it -
Is to sing a dreadful song!

See the climate changing?
Feel the planet ageing?
Thinking that you'll die before it
Is so much engaging!
Life's not really fair
Feel all that despair
Just acknowledge all the horrors
Like you really care

Tell me now how you sleep
Safe from bombs and falling fires.
Will your world just die when
They pull out tubes and wires?
Your compassion is strong
It just goes and comes along
And the only way to end it -
Is to sing a dreadful song!

Sing a very dreadful song...
Feel the dread and sing along...

Let me tell you how I sleep
Safe from bombs and falling fires.
And my world will die when
They pull out tubes and wires
My compassion is strong
It just goes and comes along
I know how to calm it down -
I just write a dreadful song!

Sing with me a dreadful song!
Feel the dread and sing along!
