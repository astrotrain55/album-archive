Are you in love with your engine of skin?
Where does it end and you begin?
Does all the pain make you feel alive?
A burn from a fire? A cut from a knife?
Blood from the cut will be lost in the soil
Little by little, ‘till nothing remains
Bring on the future where synthetic oil
Slowly replaces the blood in my veins

On your soft palate - expiration date
And someday you will find you've got used to pain
Apathy will rise, and it grows in size
Just as fast as the growing disease in your brain

Can you experience life as it is?
Excluding all the wavelengths you miss?
And every day you can feel even less
The time has come for breeding and death
My mind and my soul are a chemical process
It can be copied, deleted and more
When one door opens, the other one closes
But now we can break open all of the doors

On your soft palate - expiration date
And someday you will find you've got used to pain
Apathy will rise, and it grows in size
Just as fast as the growing disease in your brain

Are you afraid of evolving too far?
That at the end we’ll lose who we are?
If you are burning the things you oppose
Add to the pile your glasses and clothes
Take all the flesh that I could live without
Damn all the feelings, it is but a shell
Upload my soul and my mind to the cloud
While my body can go straight to hell

On your soft palate - expiration date
And someday you will find you' ve got used to pain
Apathy will rise, and it grows in size
Just as fast as the growing disease in your brain

Sometimes I dream
Of Luddites reversed
That will break down
The engines of old
Armed to the teeth
With pitchforks and torches
We'll come to the source
To start a revolt

Blood from my core
Rains on the floor
I’d rather die
Then give up control
Broken machine
The engine of skin
When you will end
Then I’ll begin

Are you in love with your engine of skin?
Where does it end and you begin?
Does all the pain make you feel alive?
A burn from a fire? A cut from a knife?
Blood from the cut will dissolve in the ocean
Little by little you rot from within
Your soul is trapped in a downward motion
Powered one-way by the engine of skin

On your soft palate - expiration date
And someday you will find you've got used to pain
Apathy will rise, and it grows in size
Just as fast as the growing disease in your brain
