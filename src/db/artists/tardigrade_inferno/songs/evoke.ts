I’m dealing with a devil
I wrote his name on the wall
The signs will unravel
A way to heal my aching soul
I’m drawing the lines on the floor
So it will not hurt anymore
My flesh is weak, my end is near
I’m at my final chapter
The death itself I do not fear,
I fear the void after
The devil has come to my call
The deal is sealed with my soul

Evoke a demon by its name
A soul exchanged to ease the pain
I leave my old form in the past
I will be free now at last

The devil is eternal
He is a part of space and time
My suffering’s internal
And now we’ve swapped his soul for mine
And I will surpass death and pain
The time will die, I’ll remain
I walk across the battlefields
Across the salted soil
A thousand years - it will heal
A million - it will boil
The time of man passes by
My new flesh refuses to die

Evoke a demon by its name
A soul exchanged to ease the pain
I leave my old form in the past
I will be free now at last

The time is ending, it fades away
Its end is witnessed by the chosen few
The smallest particle is the last to stay
And then the universe is born anew
The sorrowed tale repeats again
The age of man is rising from the ash
I hear myself calling my new name
To swap my soul back into my dying flesh

I find myself back
Returned to my old self
The time loops forever
And here I am again
I’m back to my time and my place
With an insane smile on my face
Now I’ve seen the end of time
I fear death no longer
The fear of death is gone away
Replaced with something stronger
I’m laughing, deranged, on the floor
I’m scared of eternity more

Evoke a demon by its name
A soul exchanged to ease the pain
I leave my old form in the past
I will be free now at last
