Execution’s fun
I think that you should come
To loose yourself and to relax
Just put your head under my axe
Execution’s fun
I think you should try one
To put your mind back on track
I’ll swing my axe right through your neck

Execution’s fun
And now the pain is gone
You will live forever after
And you’ll give us a little laughter
Execution’s fun
It’s not for everyone
All your records must be clean
And you must be at least eighteen

Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!

Execution’s fast
A moment that will last
Think of joy that you will bring
You’ll entertain your dear king
Chains are not free
So plan accordingly
Feel the fangs of open market
We now have PR department

Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!

King is crazy, King is mad
Ruling from the deathbed
He enjoys his bed and cushions
And the morning executions

King is crazy, King is mad
King wants just to see you dead
Life if just a bad illusion
Try my permanent solution

All prisoners are dead
So we take you instead
It is a show to see
So bring your family
Executions fun
Oh god, what have I done...

Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!

Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!
