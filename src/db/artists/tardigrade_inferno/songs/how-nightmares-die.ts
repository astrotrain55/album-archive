Lightning outside my window
Shines on her face
Nightmares are my specialty
She is my latest case
Every time she goes to sleep
She dreams of death and pain
I will help you, donâ€™t you weep
I'll cure your damaged brain

You will have to sign here
Safety first
You OK with brain drilling?
Safety first

She is sleeping terrified,
Screaming in her bed
I will steal her bad dreams through
Wires in her head
Silver bullet loaded gun will
Sing them lullaby
Pull the trigger and it's done -
That's how nightmares die!

Pockets filled with spare bullets
Safety first
Sleeping pills are non allergic
Safety first

Our heads are connected
Our dreams are intertwined
I'm ready, I welcome
The horrors of her mind
The moment of transfer
I'm doing as rehearsed
A shame I forgot to
Switch off the safety first

Lightning outside my window
Outshouts my screams
I have suffered all these years
Hosting her bad dreams
Every time I go to sleep
I dream of death and pain
Silver bullets that I keep
Will cure my damaged brain

Check if no one is around
Safety first
Point the gun and pull a trigger
Safety first
