A human mind - a fragile thing
Its walls are weaker than you think
You lock your door, you think you’re safe
And all the people think the same

No mind is ever locked for me
My voice is now my masterkey
I open doors, I crack the codes
And put a spell

And there is nothing you can hide
I’m in control once I’m inside
You’re just a vessel for my will,
An empty shell

I am a scholar, my mentor is
A wise and famous hypnotist
I feel the power, the magic force
Just like in his online course

This is the perfect place and time
To commit a perfect crime
You’d better not try to resist
Enjoy the ride

No one around, the time is right
So let me step into the light
It only takes a magic phrase
To break your mind

Hypnotize, hypnotize, watch the spirals in my eyes
Hypnotize, hypnotize, mesmerise
Hypnotize, hypnotize, play along and play it nice
Hypnotize, hypnotize, look into my eyes

It should be working, I know it is
Or I am not a hypnotist!
I have a plan, you’ve got a role
I put you on remote control

Stop giving me a silly stare
Now go away like you don't care
I know a spell, I know how to
Set you ablaze

For now consider yourself free
I have a night ahead of me
And you won’t be the last to hear
My magic phrase

Hypnotize, hypnotize, watch the spirals in my eyes
Hypnotize, hypnotize, mesmerise
Hypnotize, hypnotize, play along and play it nice
Hypnotize, hypnotize, look into my eyes

Two days have passed, now I'm prepared
Nervous a bit, a little scared
I called for them, my slaves are here
I am the master! The puppeteer!

But I have no idea how
My mentor is their master now
They all have brands just like he has
Across his face

This is not right, this is not fair!
They are giving me a blinkless stare!
And chanting, chanting my beloved
Magic phrase

Hypnotize, hypnotize, watch the spirals in my eyes
Hypnotize, hypnotize, mesmerise
Hypnotize, hypnotize, play along and play it nice
Hypnotize, hypnotize, look into my eyes
