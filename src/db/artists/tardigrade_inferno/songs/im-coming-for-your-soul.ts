The crowd is a monster, It’s drinking and laughing
It's loudly discussing Your age
But you are above it, You look like a goddess
When you come onto The stage

The crowd is violent, But it goes silent
It hungrily looks at Your skin
You heartbeat is loud. No one can put out
The flame that you’ve brought here Within

The showtime is over You rush past the crowd
You feel like you’ve been Torn apart
You lie in bed with A half-finished poem
Breathing inside in Your heart

I’m up in the attic A lonely fanatic
Your biggest admirer And fan
You´re smart and you know it, You’re more than a poet
And I’m even less than A man

Do you know that everybody
Is coming just to see your body
I am not like them at all
I am coming, I am coming...

I am coming for your soul

For your soul, for your soul
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
For your little ugly soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul

A bar in the uptown, A detuned piano
I’m waiting for you Every day
All drunks and all patrons, All thieves and all beggars
Keep singing along when You play

You've got skill and passion, But you too old-fashioned
And you’ve got nothing To sell
It’s not you desire. Your biggest admirer -
A soul-sucking demon From hell

All of them are coming here
Just to drink a glass of beer
I am not like them at all
I am coming, I am coming...

I am coming for your soul

For your soul, for your soul
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
For your little ugly soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul

Kiss your sorry skill goodbye
After I have sucked you dry
I belive that you will fail
Any minute

And I know it for a fact
There is no way you can act
Read your lines like you care,
Like you mean it!

Fame and money are so sweet
Now you’ve got no soul to eat
I’m afraid that I misjudged
It’s importance

Have no worries, have no fear
At the peak of your career
I won't be the one to ruin
Your performance

I have seen that everywhere
You will die, no one will care
Let me just fulfill my role
I am coming, I am coming...

I am coming for your soul

For your soul, for your soul
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
For your little ugly soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
