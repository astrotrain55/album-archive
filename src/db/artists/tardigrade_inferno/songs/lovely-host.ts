Please, please, please, please, please don't kill me
Just give my life a chance
And little place inside you
For me to play and dance

I will live inside  your body
will live inside your mind
We'll grow together and our
Fates will be intertwined

You are such a lovely person
You are a lovely host
I will do my best to serve you
Rest assured and of course

I will change the way you acting
The way you talk and think
Empower and encourage
You to do anything

I'm alive!
I survived!
You are such
A lovely host!

Remember that cricket
You saw long time ago?
It jumped into the ocean
And drowned down below

All crickets die in water
Then what was it about?
Maybe something was inside it
And that something wanted out?

Take a look at this blue marble
You recognize the place?
You floating above it
You are in outer space

Now you have a job in NASA
You have fulfilled your dream
So far away from home
No one can hear you scream

You fleeing from the station
You almost out of air
You wonder why you doing it
And why do even care?

You are a lovely person
And I'm your silent guide
I'm sorry for the pain that is
Crescendoing inside

Remember that cricket
You saw a long ago?
Maybe something was inside it
And that something had to go?

I'm alive!
I survived!
You were such
A lovely host!
