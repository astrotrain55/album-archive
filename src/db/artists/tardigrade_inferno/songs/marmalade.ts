Stretching, filing, against her skin
Blessed are those who are not kin
In sin, we breathe; in sex, we tie
Duct tape her legs to the red sky
Foolsome flesh allowances
The pansies raided the pantry of
Gabardine dreams, promiscuous
Delight, deny not the flavor

Custard dreams
Abusing, musing
Marmalade flesh
Naked spread am I, am I

Actors of the tragic phantom
Extend your legs to great Saturn
Brown table tops scream for cover
At the sight of your new lover

If today I die
And can't deny
The poison chosen
For tonight, tonight

Borrowed dreams, hollowed reveries
Metal pillows, pewter yellows
Furry roadkill, house on the hill
Pouring gravy on her thighs still

If today I die
And can't deny
The poison chosen
For tonight, tonight
