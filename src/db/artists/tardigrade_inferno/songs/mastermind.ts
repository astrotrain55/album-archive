The crazy scientist AKA Genius
Is carrying a bucket of ice
He has spent his last years back in his warehouse
Building a doomsday device
It's rusty and noisy,  it sparks and it's smoking ,
And powered by an exercise bike
All the equipment is turned to eleven
Waiting for the lightning to strike

I truly am a genius
I am the mastermind
With my machines I'll bring you to your knees
I will rule over mankind

The gears are turning and the hamsters are running
Powering deathmetal rays
It's storming and raining, but there is no lightning
And there will be no storms in days
Bored and distracted, he breaks it all down
Just like he did in the past
It's time to move on, to build a new one
Right in the place of the last

I truly am a genius
I am the mastermind
With my machines I'll bring you to your knees
I will rule over mankind

His tools are all  broken, and warehouse is silent
He is crying, collapsed on a floor
“What is the point of a doomsday device
I don't want to rule anymore “
But there is one final and adequate challenge
For a brilliant mind in his prime,
With the power of science, the one mastermind,
Is traveling backwards in time

A crazy scientist AKA Genius
Is carrying a bucket of ice
The beer is cold. He, lo and behold,
Won’t make the same mistake twice.
Forget all the deathrays and world domination
He is studying the game of chess!
The world will be safe while he is playing
With various degrees of success

I truly am a genius
I am the mastermind
I have just began, and after I’m done
You will find this world redefined
