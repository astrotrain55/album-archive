The drunken sailors come by
Desperate lost and frisky
Fat moms with ugly children
The smell of sweat and whiskey

The sluts are shoving aggressively
The freaks just want to start
And all the crowd is waiting
For the Circus of the dark
Of the dark

They laugh and cry and devastate and penetrate the minds of others
And these morbid angels clowns and fidgets are accepting their Misery
And the vile, self-destruction
The beauty of the nature
Exciting part of human world

So everyone is watching
They puke and bleed and fart
It’s part of their damnation
They live into the farce

If you’re addicted to something
Or maybe lost your path
You're coming to our show
To see the beauty of the dark
Of the dark

They laugh and cry and devastate and penetrate the minds of others
And these morbid angels clowns and fidgets are accepting their Misery
And the vile, self-destruction
The beauty of the nature
Exciting part of human world
