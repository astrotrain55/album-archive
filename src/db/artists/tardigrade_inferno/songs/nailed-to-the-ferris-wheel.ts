Look how it turns around
Step on the fairground
Carts on the stainless steel
Go ride my ferris wheel

Good evening m’am, Good evening sir
So glad you've come to me
Oh, may I ask, how’d I deserve
Oh, such a company?

I'm glad that I have found
A pair of you around
I've been depressed, I've looked inside
And look what I have found
I'll build a piece of art
And you will be its part
I'm nailing you to a broken wheel
To fix my broken heart

Screaming as it turns around
Bleeding on the fairground
Flesh on the stainless steel
Nailed to the ferris wheel

The fair is closed, The circus - burned
Along with the trampoline
And who am I: a tortured soul
Or just a drama queen?

My wheel is turning fast
I'm not going to last
And every minute of my life
Is tainted by my past
This symbol is displaying
A life that I had failed
I want to leave behind me something
Something that I've nailed

Screaming as it turns around
Bleeding on the fairground
Flesh on the stainless steel
Nailed to the ferris wheel

Shattered my mind!
Left me behind!
Is your ringmaster
Dying tonight?
Listen to this!
The final piece!
Let your ringmaster
Finally die in peace...

I want to make my dreams come true
And from this premise comes the rest
I tried so hard and failed hard
Doing my sincere best
To be a man I want to be
And knowing that I never will
The closest to a fair chance
Is spinning the samsara wheel

I wonder why, I wonder why
You beg to let you die
I wonder if, I wonder if
You do not want to live

To hell with your opinions
It is the work of genius
A monument to a failed life
Is not for your convenience
I could just let you free
But I want you to see
That I will never die alone
I'm taking you with me

Screaming as it turns around
Bleeding on the fairground
Flesh on the stainless steel
Nailed to the ferris wheel
