Big Rat City is in fear
Rats began to disappear
Midnight killer leaves no trails -
Tears out whiskers, cuts off tails

The world famous rat detective
Has already took the case
Photos taken, dots connected
He is pretty sure it was rats!

Dying screams are heard at night
On the streets of broken lights
Rat fatale is found dead
Small bite marks are on her head

The world famous rat detective
Has already took the case
Photos taken, dots connected
He is pretty sure it was rats!

Running, running, chasing tails
He picked up a faint scent
And he found the darkest corner
And he’s ready to descent

Take a look
Under the floor
Behind the walls
And you will find

Rats!
Rats!
Rats! Rats! Rats!

Running, running, chasing tails
Now you sure got all the facts
You have found your Midnight killer
You’ve discovered fractal rats

Even smaller
Even faster
There’s no ending
And no master

Smaller rats have smaller rats
A never-ending fractal figure
If it truly has no end
Does it mean that there are bigger?

The world famous rat detective
Has already took the case
Photos taken, dots connected
He is pretty sure it was rats!
