Tell them “baby don’t you cry”
Pat them on the shoulder
Put the splinter in the eye
And fuck with the beholder
Everything will be alright
Honey, don’t you worry
We will kill the god tonight
Better safe than sorry

I just sang the devil’s song
God gave me a warning
Fuck the rights and fuck the wrongs
We have until the morning
And tomorrow we’ll be dead
Your smile is disarming
Fuck beholder in the head
Judgment day is coming

I have tried all of the stages
Bartering and begging
I have been like this for ages
Why am I still shaking
Time and money, I got neither
And it’s getting colder
There is fear and beauty in the
Eye of the beholder

I can almost see it clear
Splinter notwithstanding
We will fucking disappear
There's no happy ending
You have my remote control
Now aim at where my heart is
I present my fucking soul
Welcome to the darkness

See the splinter in my eye
What have we done?
Is it best for us to die?
Tell no one

See how many fucks I’m giving
As I’m getting older
There is darkness hidden in the
Eye of the beholder
I see now through many lies
Now my mind is clear
Fuck beholder in the eye
Lick a broken mirror

Let me see your body naked
Stripped of the illusion
Take part of the problem make it
Part of the solution
Let your good side rest in peace
In the iron maiden
Crawling on our hands and knees
Keep calm and hail satan

See the splinter in my eye
What have we done?
Is it best for us to die?
Tell no one

See the fires in the sky?
What have we done?
All is lost, the end is nigh
We killed the sun

Burn the splinter in my eye!
Make it undone!
Is that something we can hide?
Tell no one
