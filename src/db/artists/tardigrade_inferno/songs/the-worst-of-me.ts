I was walking through the park
Fast and light
And It felt so nice and cool
Then I met the pretty duck
I said "Hi"
He reacted oh, so cruel

What have I done to you, creature?
I could barely whisper
"Darling, why?
Please, do not do this!"

I don't want to hurt you
You don't need to quack
Let me go, leave me
You stupid little duck

Violence is the shortest way
To bring out the worst of me
So you should better run away
Your payback is gonna be severe

Suddenly I lost my mind
All turned black
When the wrathful bird attacked
I remember wooden stick
Hard enough
To beat up the nasty duck

Violence is the shortest way
To bring out the worst of me
So you should better run away
Your payback is gonna be severe

I'll remember
I'll remember
I'll remember
I'll remember
You are bleeding
You are dead
I'll remember
'till my death

Fell into the puddle
He's bleeding from his ear
I can not take my anger back
There are no more nice ducks here
Hate me hate me I earned this
Now I see it clear
This was the last duck - what a twist
I bury my heart near

Violence is the shortest way
To bring out the worst of me
So you should better run away
Your payback is gonna be

I feel so bad, I feel so low
My soul became a salty flow
His flesh will rot and bones will glow
Doesn't matter but I know
