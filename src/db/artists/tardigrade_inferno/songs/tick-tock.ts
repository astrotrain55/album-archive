Tick-tock, tick-tock
Time is up, death-o-clock
When the time is ticking
Your lifetime is shrinking
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Sun is up, get to work
Better start working
Or you'll hate yourself

I know exactly what the time is
I do not need no fucking clocks
I hear the footsteps of death behind me
They sound like ticking, they never stop
Every second I am not working
I feel I’m wasting my finite time
The clocks are ticking, the clocks are talking
I almost hear them in my mind

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Time is up, death-o-clock
When the time is ticking
Your lifetime is shrinking
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Sun is up, get to work
Better start working
Or you'll hate yourself

And after every action
My soul shrinks in size
A fraction of a fraction
Dies

I tried to follow the dream I’d chosen -
I was as lost as I was before
I tried to stop, tried to smell the roses
They smelled like tension, and nothing more
The time is slipping right through my fingers
Something’s broken inside my brain
The time is passing, and I can feel this
If I were me I would go insane

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Time is up, death-o-clock
When the time is ticking
Your lifetime is shrinking
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Sun is up, get to work
Better start working
Or you'll hate yourself

And after every action
My soul shrinks in size
A fraction of a fraction
Dies

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Deep inside something broke
Life could be fine
If you’ve got the time
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Time is up, death-o-clock
Better start working
Like it’s your final day

By counting all your fears
You will go down fast
In hundred thousand years
My soul will turn to dust
The plethora of choices
To live or chase my dream
No matter what the choice is
I’ll hate myself for it

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Time is up, death-o-clock
When the time is ticking
Your lifetime is shrinking
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Sun is up, get to work
Better start working
Or you'll hear

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Deep inside something broke
Life could be fine
If you’ve got the time
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Sun is up, get to work
Better start working
Or you'll hate yourself

And after every action
My soul shrinks in size
A fraction of a fraction
Dies

And every night I hear
The ticking in my head
When I wake up I feel
Dead

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Everything is too long
I am simply waiting
Waiting for my death
Tick-tock, tick-tock
How much time you have left
Now you’ve got four minutes,
Thirty seconds less
