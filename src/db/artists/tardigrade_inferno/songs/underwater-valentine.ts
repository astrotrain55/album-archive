Lady, please Take my hand
I have strong and steady grip
Let me take You with me
To my humble pirate ship

We will sit Down between
Crates with rum and turpentine
Will you be Here with me
Will you be my valentine?

Have no fear for sea devil
You’re my damsel in distress
We will sail into sunset
Then it’s time to undress
Orlop deck is waiting for us
Down below the waterline
I will be with you forever
I’m your underwater valentine

Take a look At my hook
Bought it on a pirate sale
Lost my arm In a fight
With a giant killer whale

We can do What we want
Anchor up and sail away
We can watch a TV show
In my humble pirate bay

Have no fear for sea devil
You’re my damsel in distress
We will sail into sunset
Then it’s time to undress
Orlop deck is waiting for us
Down below the waterline
I will be with you forever
I’m your underwater valentine

Lady please, Not the neck
You have strong and steady grip
I will stay away from you
And your gorgeous pirate ship

Took my hook Told me to
Throw myself over the rail
Now I sleep With my arm
Deep inside a killer whale

Have no fear for sea devil,
Whales - that’s your final test
First it eats your handless body
Then it’s time to digest
You are sleeping with my treasure
Down below the waterline
I will haunt you forever.
I’m your underwater valentine
