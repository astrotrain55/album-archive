Come out en masse, dance on the grass
And feel the sunlight on your skin
It's nothing but pure joy and love
And everything is colored green
My microscope and stethoscope
Will leave you greatly terrified
I'll check your gums, I'll check your lungs
I'm scary, and I'm wearing white

The sun is bright, you feel alright
I know exactly how it feels
But just your mood will do no good
You need your medicine and pills
Lives are at stake, I will not break
The Hippocratic Oath I gave
Bark from a tree and herbal tea
Will lead you straight into the grave

I smell your fear, and I feel tremors in your knees
And I can say in Latin the name of your disease
It’s all unnatural what we will do tonight
I smell of medicine, I stand here, wearing white

Forget your plans, I’ve got your scans
And I’m afraid I have bad news
You feel alright, but you will die
Unless we stuff you full of tubes
It will be worse, the choice is yours
The time is up, the stakes are high
But know: it's wrong to live too long
And it is natural to die

I smell your fear, and I feel tremors in your knees
And I can say in Latin the name of your disease
It’s all unnatural what we will do tonight
I smell of medicine, I stand here, wearing white

You will be cured by any means
Ignore your white coat phobia
The sterile tools and cold machines
Are coded as dystopia
Open your eyes - you could’ve died
Look at yourself - you are feeling alright
Now go and spread your insanity
Go on and preach your humanity

I smell your fear, and I feel tremors in your knees
And I can say in Latin the name of your disease
I could choose green, but I chose medicine instead
I’m wearing white because white goes best with red
