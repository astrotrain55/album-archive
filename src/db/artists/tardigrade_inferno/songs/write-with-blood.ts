  text: `
You feel weaker with every passing day
Feel new pain - you know it’s here to stay
All the people - you know they feel the same
Growing older and going less insane

Put your hat on and run into the mud
Trace the killer by following the blood
You will find new evidence and hints
Rip and tear and take the fingerprints

And the only thing you’ll need -
Not to be afraid to bleed
Put your blood inside the story
Story writes itself indeed

Do you see it, do you not?
You will die and you will rot
If you want to write your story
Write your story with your blood

Rain is pouring down on your aching hip
Go home early - you need some extra sleep
Have a nightmare about drowning down
Bleed a little, enough to write it down


Grab your helmet and dive into the deep
Sneak right into the King of Herrings keep
Rip its heart out! And steal the coral crown!
Drain the ocean, so you will never drown

And the only thing you’ll need -
Not to be afraid to bleed
Put your blood inside the story
Story writes itself indeed

Do you see it, do you not?
You will die and you will rot
If you want to live forever
Write your story with your blood

Write your story with your blood

Try to find a perfect rhyme online
To tell a story for the millionth time
You have neither strength nor skill, nor time
And every day you feel like dead or dying

Bury deep your head, it will grow roots
Your body will turn into trees and fruits
And birds and bees will feed upon your flesh
The Sun will die and turn them into ash

Blood from your veins
Will go in vain
All that remains
Is for you to try again

And the only thing you’ll need -
Not to be afraid to bleed
Put your blood inside the story
Story writes itself indeed

Do you see it, do you not?
You will die and you will rot
Do you want to live forever?
Write your story with your blood
